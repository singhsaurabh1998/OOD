Great! Let's begin with **Task 1: Coffee Machine (Basic Version)** — this is a perfect beginner-friendly problem to understand **class design**, **OOP principles**, and a bit of **SOLID thinking**.

---

## ☕ Coffee Machine – Requirements

### Functional Requirements:

1. The coffee machine can make beverages like:

    * Espresso
    * Cappuccino
    * Latte
2. Each beverage requires specific ingredients (like water, milk, coffee).
3. The machine should throw an error if ingredients are not sufficient.
4. It should allow refilling ingredients.
5. Should be easily extendable to add new beverages.

---

## 🎯 Goals

* Use **classes**, **interfaces**, and **encapsulation**.
* Follow **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**.
* Apply **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**.

---

## 📦 Basic Class Design

### ✅ Entities

* `Ingredient`: Represents a type of ingredient (e.g., Water, Milk).
* `Inventory`: Stores and manages quantities of each ingredient.
* `Beverage`: Interface or abstract class for all beverages.
* `Espresso`, `Latte`, `Cappuccino`: Concrete beverages.
* `CoffeeMachine`: Prepares beverages and interacts with inventory.

---

## ✅ Let's Start with Java Code (Step-by-Step)

We'll begin with step 1: **Ingredient and Inventory**

```java
import java.util.*;

// Ingredient Enum
enum Ingredient {
    WATER, MILK, COFFEE_BEANS, SUGAR
}

// Inventory class: Manages ingredient quantities
class Inventory {
    private Map<Ingredient, Integer> stock = new HashMap<>();

    public Inventory() {
        for (Ingredient ing : Ingredient.values()) {
            stock.put(ing, 0);
        }
    }

    // Refill ingredients
    public void addIngredient(Ingredient ingredient, int quantity) {
        stock.put(ingredient, stock.getOrDefault(ingredient, 0) + quantity);
    }

    // Check if ingredients are available
    public boolean hasSufficient(Map<Ingredient, Integer> required) {
        for (Map.Entry<Ingredient, Integer> entry : required.entrySet()) {
            if (stock.getOrDefault(entry.getKey(), 0) < entry.getValue()) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    // Deduct ingredients after making a beverage
    public void useIngredients(Map<Ingredient, Integer> required) {
        for (Map.Entry<Ingredient, Integer> entry : required.entrySet()) {
            stock.put(entry.getKey(), stock.get(entry.getKey()) - entry.getValue());
        }
    }

    public void printStock() {
        System.out.println("Current Stock:");
        for (Map.Entry<Ingredient, Integer> entry : stock.entrySet()) {
            System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ": " + entry.getValue());
        }
    }
}
```

---

## ✅ Next Step:

Do you want to proceed to define the **Beverage hierarchy** (`Beverage`, `Espresso`, etc.) and then `CoffeeMachine` class?
Or would you like me to first explain how the above `Inventory` class follows **SRP** and prepares for **OCP**?

Let me know your preference and I’ll continue accordingly!
Awesome! Let’s move on to the **Beverage Hierarchy**, which will help us make the design open for extension (new beverages) and closed for modification — a classic **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** application.

---

## ☕ Beverage Hierarchy Design

We’ll define:

### ✅ 1. `Beverage` (Abstract Class or Interface)

* Method: `getRequiredIngredients()`: Returns the list of ingredients needed to prepare this beverage.
* Method: `getName()`: Returns the beverage name.

### ✅ 2. Concrete Beverages

* `Espresso`
* `Latte`
* `Cappuccino`

---

## ✅ Java Code for Beverage Hierarchy

```java
import java.util.*;

// Beverage Interface
interface Beverage {
    String getName();
    Map<Ingredient, Integer> getRequiredIngredients();
}

// Espresso Implementation
class Espresso implements Beverage {
    public String getName() {
        return "Espresso";
    }

    public Map<Ingredient, Integer> getRequiredIngredients() {
        Map<Ingredient, Integer> ingredients = new HashMap<>();
        ingredients.put(Ingredient.WATER, 50);
        ingredients.put(Ingredient.COFFEE_BEANS, 18);
        return ingredients;
    }
}

// Latte Implementation
class Latte implements Beverage {
    public String getName() {
        return "Latte";
    }

    public Map<Ingredient, Integer> getRequiredIngredients() {
        Map<Ingredient, Integer> ingredients = new HashMap<>();
        ingredients.put(Ingredient.WATER, 200);
        ingredients.put(Ingredient.MILK, 150);
        ingredients.put(Ingredient.COFFEE_BEANS, 24);
        return ingredients;
    }
}

// Cappuccino Implementation
class Cappuccino implements Beverage {
    public String getName() {
        return "Cappuccino";
    }

    public Map<Ingredient, Integer> getRequiredIngredients() {
        Map<Ingredient, Integer> ingredients = new HashMap<>();
        ingredients.put(Ingredient.WATER, 250);
        ingredients.put(Ingredient.MILK, 100);
        ingredients.put(Ingredient.COFFEE_BEANS, 24);
        return ingredients;
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Explanation:

* Each beverage knows **what ingredients** it needs.
* You can add a **new beverage** like `Mocha` just by implementing the interface — without touching any other code.

---

## ✅ Next Step:

Shall we now define the `CoffeeMachine` class which:

* Takes a `Beverage` object
* Checks ingredient availability
* Deducts ingredients
* Prepares the beverage?

Or do you want to go over how this design follows **OCP and SRP** first?

Let me know — I’ll continue accordingly!
Perfect! Now let’s build the main component: the **`CoffeeMachine`** class.

---

## ☕ `CoffeeMachine` Class – Responsibilities

### What should this class do?

* Take a `Beverage` request.
* Check if required ingredients are available via `Inventory`.
* Deduct ingredients if available.
* Print success or failure messages.
* Optionally, expose a method to **refill ingredients**.

This class will act as the **orchestrator**, and we will apply the **Single Responsibility Principle** by letting `Inventory` handle storage, and `Beverage` handle recipe logic.

---

## ✅ Java Code for `CoffeeMachine`

```java
class CoffeeMachine {
    private Inventory inventory;

    public CoffeeMachine(Inventory inventory) {
        this.inventory = inventory;
    }

    public void prepareBeverage(Beverage beverage) {
        System.out.println("Preparing: " + beverage.getName());

        if (!inventory.hasSufficient(beverage.getRequiredIngredients())) {
            System.out.println("❌ Cannot prepare " + beverage.getName() + ": Not enough ingredients.");
            return;
        }

        inventory.useIngredients(beverage.getRequiredIngredients());
        System.out.println("✅ " + beverage.getName() + " is ready!");
    }

    public void refillIngredient(Ingredient ingredient, int quantity) {
        inventory.addIngredient(ingredient, quantity);
        System.out.println("✔️ Refilled " + ingredient + " by " + quantity);
    }

    public void showInventory() {
        inventory.printStock();
    }
}
```

---

## ✅ Example Main Method to Test Everything

```java
public class CoffeeMachineTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Inventory inventory = new Inventory();

        CoffeeMachine machine = new CoffeeMachine(inventory);

        // Refill initial stock
        machine.refillIngredient(Ingredient.WATER, 500);
        machine.refillIngredient(Ingredient.MILK, 300);
        machine.refillIngredient(Ingredient.COFFEE_BEANS, 100);

        machine.showInventory();

        // Try preparing beverages
        machine.prepareBeverage(new Espresso());
        machine.prepareBeverage(new Latte());
        machine.prepareBeverage(new Cappuccino());

        machine.showInventory();

        // Try again with insufficient stock
        machine.prepareBeverage(new Latte());
    }
}
```

---

## ✅ Output (Sample)

```
✔️ Refilled WATER by 500
✔️ Refilled MILK by 300
✔️ Refilled COFFEE_BEANS by 100
Current Stock:
WATER: 500
MILK: 300
COFFEE_BEANS: 100
SUGAR: 0
Preparing: Espresso
✅ Espresso is ready!
Preparing: Latte
✅ Latte is ready!
Preparing: Cappuccino
✅ Cappuccino is ready!
Current Stock:
WATER: 0
MILK: 50
COFFEE_BEANS: 34
SUGAR: 0
Preparing: Latte
❌ Cannot prepare Latte: Not enough ingredients.
```

---

## 💡 What You’ve Learned Here:

* Applying **SRP**: Each class handles its own responsibility.
* Applying **OCP**: Adding a new beverage doesn't require modifying `CoffeeMachine`.
* Using **interfaces & encapsulation** effectively.

---

## 🔁 Next Step:

Would you like to:

1. Refactor this using **Factory Pattern**? (Creating beverages dynamically)
2. Add **multi-threading** or simulate **multiple outlets**? (A step toward system design)
3. Move to the **next simple design exercise** (like a Vending Machine or Library System)?

Let me know your preferred direction!


Yes, exactly! 💡

The **`CoffeeMachine`** class is functioning as a **service class** in the context of Object-Oriented Design.

---

### ✅ Why is `CoffeeMachine` a Service Class?

A **service class**:

* **Coordinates** multiple objects (like `Beverage`, `Inventory`).
* **Encapsulates business logic** (e.g., making a beverage).
* **Does not hold its own data** (beyond dependencies like `Inventory`).
* Follows the **Single Responsibility Principle**: One responsibility — in this case, managing coffee preparation.

---

### 📌 Analogy in Real World:

In a real application like a Spring Boot project:

* `CoffeeMachine` would be annotated as `@Service`.
* It would be injected with an `Inventory` repository or manager.
* Beverages could be dynamically created via a **factory** or injected via strategy.

---

### 🔧 Role of `CoffeeMachine`:

| Responsibility             | Belongs To           |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Defines beverage recipe    | `Beverage` classes   |
| Manages ingredient stock   | `Inventory` class    |
| Orchestrates preparation   | ✅ `CoffeeMachine`    |
| Refill/consume ingredients | `Inventory`          |
| Extend with new drinks     | `Beverage` hierarchy |

---

If you're comfortable with this now, the **next evolution** could be:

* Applying **Factory Pattern** to cleanly create beverages
* Adding **interfaces** for inventory (to swap for mock/testing)
* Adding **unit tests**

Would you like to evolve this into a slightly more real-world design with such additions?

**Applying Factory Pattern to cleanly create beverages?**

Awesome! Let’s now **refactor the beverage creation logic using the Factory Pattern** — a perfect next step to improve the design and make it more **extensible, decoupled, and testable**.

---

## 🏭 Why Use the Factory Pattern Here?

Currently, in `main()`, we directly do:

```java
machine.prepareBeverage(new Espresso());
```

🔴 This is **tight coupling** — we’re directly creating objects.

✅ Using a **Factory Pattern** will:

* Centralize object creation
* Allow dynamic creation from a string input (like `"Espresso"`)
* Make it easy to add new beverages without changing code all over

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step: Implement BeverageFactory

### 🔹 Step 1: Define the Factory Interface (optional but good practice)

```java
interface BeverageFactory {
    Beverage createBeverage(String beverageName);
}
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Implement the Factory

```java
class SimpleBeverageFactory implements BeverageFactory {
    public Beverage createBeverage(String beverageName) {
        switch (beverageName.toLowerCase()) {
            case "espresso":
                return new Espresso();
            case "latte":
                return new Latte();
            case "cappuccino":
                return new Cappuccino();
            default:
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("❌ Unknown beverage: " + beverageName);
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Update CoffeeMachine to Use Factory

```java
class CoffeeMachine {
    private Inventory inventory;
    private BeverageFactory beverageFactory;

    public CoffeeMachine(Inventory inventory, BeverageFactory factory) {
        this.inventory = inventory;
        this.beverageFactory = factory;
    }

    public void prepareBeverage(String beverageName) {
        try {
            Beverage beverage = beverageFactory.createBeverage(beverageName);
            System.out.println("Preparing: " + beverage.getName());

            if (!inventory.hasSufficient(beverage.getRequiredIngredients())) {
                System.out.println("❌ Cannot prepare " + beverage.getName() + ": Not enough ingredients.");
                return;
            }

            inventory.useIngredients(beverage.getRequiredIngredients());
            System.out.println("✅ " + beverage.getName() + " is ready!");
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    public void refillIngredient(Ingredient ingredient, int quantity) {
        inventory.addIngredient(ingredient, quantity);
        System.out.println("✔️ Refilled " + ingredient + " by " + quantity);
    }

    public void showInventory() {
        inventory.printStock();
    }
}
```

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Updated Main Method

```java
public class CoffeeMachineTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Inventory inventory = new Inventory();
        BeverageFactory factory = new SimpleBeverageFactory();
        CoffeeMachine machine = new CoffeeMachine(inventory, factory);

        // Refill ingredients
        machine.refillIngredient(Ingredient.WATER, 500);
        machine.refillIngredient(Ingredient.MILK, 300);
        machine.refillIngredient(Ingredient.COFFEE_BEANS, 100);

        machine.showInventory();

        // Prepare beverages by name
        machine.prepareBeverage("Espresso");
        machine.prepareBeverage("Latte");
        machine.prepareBeverage("Cappuccino");
        machine.prepareBeverage("Mocha");  // Will throw unknown beverage error
    }
}
```

---

## ✅ Benefits of This Refactor

| Improvement                | Description                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Open/Closed Principle    | Add new beverage without changing `CoffeeMachine` |
| ✅ Single Responsibility    | `CoffeeMachine` focuses on orchestration only     |
| ✅ Easy to Test/Mock        | Can inject a mock `BeverageFactory` in tests      |
| ✅ Extendable via String UI | Add UI/CLI later by simply passing string input   |

---

### ✅ Next Step Options:

Would you like to:

1. Add a **new beverage (like Mocha)** to see how easily it fits in?
2. Extend it with **multi-threading outlets** (simulate real machines)?
3. Move on to the **next beginner-friendly design problem**?

Let me know your pick — you're doing great so far!
**Extend it with multi-threading outlets (simulate real machines)?Explain in a very structured way by giving proper reasoning**

Excellent! You're now entering the world of **concurrency in Object-Oriented Design**, which is very common in system design interviews and real-world scenarios.

Let’s **extend the Coffee Machine to support multiple outlets using multi-threading** — just like real machines in cafes!

---

## ☕ Problem Statement

Real-world coffee machines have **multiple outlets** (say 2–4), so multiple beverages can be made **simultaneously**.
We want to simulate this behavior in code using **Java Threads** or `ExecutorService`.

---

## 🔧 What Will Change?

### ✅ Before:

* Beverages are prepared **one at a time**, sequentially.

### ✅ After:

* Beverages will be prepared **in parallel**, using multiple outlets.
* Each outlet is a **separate thread**.

---

## 🎯 Design Goals

| Requirement                             | Solution                             |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Multiple outlets                        | Use a thread pool                    |
| Thread-safe ingredient handling         | Synchronize access to `Inventory`    |
| Configurable number of outlets          | Make outlets configurable in machine |
| Graceful handling of insufficient stock | Already handled by `Inventory` check |

---

## 🔁 Step-by-Step Plan

---

### ✅ Step 1: Make `Inventory` Thread-Safe

We need to **synchronize access** to shared stock to avoid race conditions.

```java
class Inventory {
    private Map<Ingredient, Integer> stock = new HashMap<>();

    public Inventory() {
        for (Ingredient ing : Ingredient.values()) {
            stock.put(ing, 0);
        }
    }

    public synchronized void addIngredient(Ingredient ingredient, int quantity) {
        stock.put(ingredient, stock.getOrDefault(ingredient, 0) + quantity);
    }

    public synchronized boolean hasSufficient(Map<Ingredient, Integer> required) {
        for (Map.Entry<Ingredient, Integer> entry : required.entrySet()) {
            if (stock.getOrDefault(entry.getKey(), 0) < entry.getValue()) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public synchronized void useIngredients(Map<Ingredient, Integer> required) {
        for (Map.Entry<Ingredient, Integer> entry : required.entrySet()) {
            stock.put(entry.getKey(), stock.get(entry.getKey()) - entry.getValue());
        }
    }

    public synchronized void printStock() {
        System.out.println("Current Stock:");
        for (Map.Entry<Ingredient, Integer> entry : stock.entrySet()) {
            System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ": " + entry.getValue());
        }
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: Use `ExecutorService` in `CoffeeMachine`

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

class CoffeeMachine {
    private final Inventory inventory;
    private final BeverageFactory factory;
    private final ExecutorService outlets;

    public CoffeeMachine(Inventory inventory, BeverageFactory factory, int outletCount) {
        this.inventory = inventory;
        this.factory = factory;
        this.outlets = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(outletCount);
    }

    public void prepareBeverage(String beverageName) {
        outlets.submit(() -> {
            try {
                Beverage beverage = factory.createBeverage(beverageName);
                System.out.println("Preparing: " + beverage.getName() + " on " + Thread.currentThread().getName());

                if (!inventory.hasSufficient(beverage.getRequiredIngredients())) {
                    System.out.println("❌ Cannot prepare " + beverage.getName() + ": Not enough ingredients.");
                    return;
                }

                inventory.useIngredients(beverage.getRequiredIngredients());
                System.out.println("✅ " + beverage.getName() + " is ready on " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
                System.out.println(e.getMessage());
            }
        });
    }

    public void refillIngredient(Ingredient ingredient, int quantity) {
        inventory.addIngredient(ingredient, quantity);
        System.out.println("✔️ Refilled " + ingredient + " by " + quantity);
    }

    public void showInventory() {
        inventory.printStock();
    }

    public void shutdown() {
        outlets.shutdown();
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Updated Main Method for Multi-threading

```java
public class CoffeeMachineTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Inventory inventory = new Inventory();
        BeverageFactory factory = new SimpleBeverageFactory();

        // 3 outlets (threads)
        CoffeeMachine machine = new CoffeeMachine(inventory, factory, 3);

        // Refill ingredients
        machine.refillIngredient(Ingredient.WATER, 1000);
        machine.refillIngredient(Ingredient.MILK, 500);
        machine.refillIngredient(Ingredient.COFFEE_BEANS, 300);

        machine.showInventory();

        // Parallel beverage preparation
        machine.prepareBeverage("Espresso");
        machine.prepareBeverage("Latte");
        machine.prepareBeverage("Cappuccino");
        machine.prepareBeverage("Latte");
        machine.prepareBeverage("Espresso");

        // Allow time for threads to finish
        try {
            Thread.sleep(3000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }

        machine.showInventory();
        machine.shutdown();
    }
}
```

---

## ✅ Sample Output

```
✔️ Refilled WATER by 1000
✔️ Refilled MILK by 500
✔️ Refilled COFFEE_BEANS by 300
Preparing: Espresso on pool-1-thread-1
Preparing: Latte on pool-1-thread-2
Preparing: Cappuccino on pool-1-thread-3
✅ Espresso is ready on pool-1-thread-1
✅ Latte is ready on pool-1-thread-2
✅ Cappuccino is ready on pool-1-thread-3
Preparing: Latte on pool-1-thread-2
Preparing: Espresso on pool-1-thread-1
✅ Latte is ready on pool-1-thread-2
✅ Espresso is ready on pool-1-thread-1
```

## ✅ Benefits of Multi-Threaded Design

| Advantage                       | Explanation                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Simulates real machines       | Each outlet works independently       |
| ✅ Parallel beverage preparation | Saves time, increases throughput      |
| ✅ Thread-safe inventory         | Prevents data races & inconsistencies |
| ✅ Scalable design               | Easily configurable outlet count      |

---

## 🧠 Key Learning:

* Multi-threading is crucial in **real-time systems**.
* Always **synchronize shared resources** (like `Inventory`) to avoid race conditions.
* Use `ExecutorService` for better thread management than manually creating `Thread`.

---

### ➕ Optional Next Steps:

Would you like to:

1. Add dynamic beverage recipes via config (e.g. `JSON`-like map)?
2. Add a **priority queue** for beverages?
3. Move on to the next design (Vending Machine or Library System)?

**Explain each & every line of CoffeeMachine class, and I am completely new to Multithreading, explain how ExecutorService  is helping us lastly rewrite the code without lambda expression**

Absolutely! Let's do a **line-by-line breakdown** of the `CoffeeMachine` class with a deep explanation — especially focusing on **multithreading and `ExecutorService`**. I’ll also rewrite the code **without lambda expressions**, so it's easier for you to understand if you’re new to Java concurrency.

---

## ☕ Full Explanation: `CoffeeMachine` Class with Threads

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
```

### 👉 `ExecutorService` and `Executors`:

* These are Java concurrency classes used to manage a pool of threads.
* Instead of manually creating `Thread t = new Thread(...)`, we submit tasks to a thread pool.
* `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(n)` creates a pool of `n` reusable threads.

---

```java
class CoffeeMachine {
    private final Inventory inventory;
    private final BeverageFactory factory;
    private final ExecutorService outlets;
```

### ☑️ Instance Variables:

* `inventory`: manages the stock of ingredients (shared resource).
* `factory`: creates `Beverage` objects from names like `"Espresso"`.
* `outlets`: thread pool simulating outlets; each outlet prepares beverages in parallel.

---

```java
    public CoffeeMachine(Inventory inventory, BeverageFactory factory, int outletCount) {
        this.inventory = inventory;
        this.factory = factory;
        this.outlets = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(outletCount);
    }
```

### ☑️ Constructor:

* Accepts inventory, beverage factory, and number of outlets.
* `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(outletCount)`:

    * Creates a pool of fixed-size threads.
    * Simulates multiple outlets working in **parallel**.
    * If `outletCount = 3`, 3 beverages can be prepared at the same time.

---

```java
    public void prepareBeverage(final String beverageName) {
        outlets.submit(new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                try {
                    Beverage beverage = factory.createBeverage(beverageName);
                    System.out.println("Preparing: " + beverage.getName() + " on " + Thread.currentThread().getName());

                    if (!inventory.hasSufficient(beverage.getRequiredIngredients())) {
                        System.out.println("❌ Cannot prepare " + beverage.getName() + ": Not enough ingredients.");
                        return;
                    }

                    inventory.useIngredients(beverage.getRequiredIngredients());
                    System.out.println("✅ " + beverage.getName() + " is ready on " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
                } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
                    System.out.println(e.getMessage());

            }
        });
    }

### ☑️ `prepareBeverage` (Multithreaded)

* Takes the name of the beverage (e.g., `"Latte"`).
* Submits a `Runnable` (task) to the `ExecutorService` thread pool.
* **Each beverage preparation runs in a separate thread** from the pool.

🔍 Inside the `Runnable`:

* `factory.createBeverage()` creates the beverage.
* `inventory.hasSufficient()` checks if ingredients are available.
* `inventory.useIngredients()` deducts used ingredients.
* `Thread.currentThread().getName()` prints which thread (outlet) is working.

⚠️ This is all synchronized in `Inventory`, so **no race conditions** occur even when threads run in parallel.

---

```java
    public void refillIngredient(Ingredient ingredient, int quantity) {
        inventory.addIngredient(ingredient, quantity);
        System.out.println("✔️ Refilled " + ingredient + " by " + quantity);
    }
```

* Lets you refill stock. Calls `Inventory` method which is thread-safe (`synchronized`).

---

```java
    public void showInventory() {
        inventory.printStock();
    }
```

* Just prints the current inventory.

---

```java
    public void shutdown() {
        outlets.shutdown();
    }
```

* Gracefully shuts down the thread pool when you're done preparing beverages.
* Important to avoid keeping unused threads alive forever.

## ✅ Final `CoffeeMachine` Class (No Lambdas)

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

class CoffeeMachine {
    private final Inventory inventory;
    private final BeverageFactory factory;
    private final ExecutorService outlets;

    public CoffeeMachine(Inventory inventory, BeverageFactory factory, int outletCount) {
        this.inventory = inventory;
        this.factory = factory;
        this.outlets = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(outletCount);
    }

    public void prepareBeverage(final String beverageName) {
        outlets.submit(new BeverageTask(beverageName));
    }

    public void refillIngredient(Ingredient ingredient, int quantity) {
        inventory.addIngredient(ingredient, quantity);
        System.out.println("✔️ Refilled " + ingredient + " by " + quantity);
    }

    public void showInventory() {
        inventory.printStock();
    }

    public void shutdown() {
        outlets.shutdown();
    }

    // Inner class to represent a beverage preparation task
    class BeverageTask implements Runnable {
        private final String beverageName;

        BeverageTask(String beverageName) {
            this.beverageName = beverageName;
        }

        public void run() {
            try {
                Beverage beverage = factory.createBeverage(beverageName);
                System.out.println("Preparing: " + beverage.getName() + " on " + Thread.currentThread().getName());

                if (!inventory.hasSufficient(beverage.getRequiredIngredients())) {
                    System.out.println("❌ Cannot prepare " + beverage.getName() + ": Not enough ingredients.");
                    return;
                }

                inventory.useIngredients(beverage.getRequiredIngredients());
                System.out.println("✅ " + beverage.getName() + " is ready on " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
                System.out.println(e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Would you like to **visualize how threads run**, or should we move to the next design enhancement (e.g., command queue, time-based preparation, etc.)?
**but how we're making sure on each call of outlets.submit(new BeverageTask(beverageName));
new thread has been assigned to it ?is it happening automatically?**

Excellent and very important question! ✅

Yes — the **assignment of a thread** to each task in:

```java
outlets.submit(new BeverageTask(beverageName));
```

…**is handled automatically** by Java’s `ExecutorService` when using `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(n)`.

Let’s break this down in a **very beginner-friendly and structured** way:

---

## 🎯 What Is `ExecutorService` Doing Internally?

```java
ExecutorService outlets = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
```

This line:

* Creates a thread pool with **exactly 3 threads**.
* Internally maintains a **task queue** (like a linked queue).
* Each thread continuously **picks up tasks** from the queue when it's free.

---

## ✅ How Does `.submit()` Work?

When you call:

```java
outlets.submit(new BeverageTask("Latte"));
```

Java does this:

1. Places `new BeverageTask("Latte")` into an **internal task queue**.
2. If any thread from the pool is **idle**, it picks this task and **executes it**.
3. If **all threads are busy**, the task waits in the queue.

---

### 🔁 Example: Pool of 3 Threads, 5 Tasks Submitted

Let’s say:

```java
ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
pool.submit(new Task1());  // Thread-1 picks it
pool.submit(new Task2());  // Thread-2 picks it
pool.submit(new Task3());  // Thread-3 picks it
pool.submit(new Task4());  // Task4 goes to queue (waiting)
pool.submit(new Task5());  // Task5 goes to queue (waiting)
```

* Once any thread (say Thread-2) finishes Task2, it picks Task4.
* Then Task5, and so on.

✅ **Thread assignment is automatic.**
You don’t need to manage or create threads manually.

---

## 🧠 How It Ensures Thread Reuse Instead of New Threads Every Time?

The fixed thread pool is designed to:

* Create **exactly `n` threads (say 3) once**
* **Reuse** them for every new task
* Avoid the overhead of creating/destroying threads

So:

* Even if you submit 100 tasks — only 3 threads are used.
* Java handles scheduling using an internal queue + thread worker logic.

## ✅ Summary Table

| Question                              | Answer                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Do we create a new thread every time? | ❌ No. Threads are created once and reused.       |
| Who assigns threads to tasks?         | ✅ The `ExecutorService` manages it internally.   |
| What if all threads are busy?         | ⏳ Task waits in a queue until a thread is free.  |
| Is thread reuse efficient?            | ✅ Yes. Avoids overhead, perfect for performance. |
| How many threads are created?         | Equal to `n` in `newFixedThreadPool(n)`          |

---

## ✅ Visualization (for 3 threads)

```
[Task1] ---> Thread-1  [Busy]
[Task2] ---> Thread-2  [Busy]
[Task3] ---> Thread-3  [Busy]
[Task4] ---> (Waiting in queue)
[Task5] ---> (Waiting in queue)

After Thread-2 finishes:
[Task4] ---> Thread-2 (now picks Task4)
```

---

Would you like me to show you how to **log and track which thread runs which beverage task**, just to visually confirm this behavior?

Or shall we move ahead and **extend the design further** (e.g., custom wait times, ingredients alerts, etc.)?
