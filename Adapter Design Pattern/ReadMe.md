Great question üëç Let‚Äôs go step by step so you not only understand **Adapter Design Pattern**, but also **why it exists** and when to use it.

# 1. The Problem (Without Adapter)

Imagine you are writing a **payment system**:

* Your code expects a `PaymentProcessor` interface with a method `pay(amount)`.
* But your company integrates with **third-party APIs**:

    * Stripe expects `makePayment(int dollars)`
    * PayPal expects `sendMoney(double usd)`

üëâ Problem: **Your code and the third-party code don‚Äôt have matching interfaces.**
You can‚Äôt directly plug them in.

---

# 2. What Adapter Solves

The **Adapter Pattern** solves the problem of **incompatible interfaces** by creating a middle layer (the adapter) that:

* **Implements your expected interface**
* **Translates calls** into the format the third-party API understands

Think of it like a **power adapter**:

* Your laptop charger expects a 3-pin plug.
* The wall socket has 2 holes.
* The **adapter** converts the plug shape so they can connect.
* Neither the laptop nor the wall socket needs to change. ‚úÖ

# 3. Structure

```
Client ---> Target Interface ---> Adapter ---> Adaptee (existing/third-party class)
```

* **Client**: your application code
* **Target Interface**: what client expects
* **Adaptee**: existing/third-party class with incompatible interface
* **Adapter**: makes Adaptee‚Äôs interface usable by Client

---

# 4. Example in Java

### Target Interface (what client expects)

```java
interface PaymentProcessor {
    void pay(double amount);
}
```

### Adaptee (third-party API, can‚Äôt change)

```java
class StripeAPI {
    public void makePayment(int dollars) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + dollars + " via Stripe");
    }
}

class PayPalAPI {
    public void sendMoney(double usd) {
        System.out.println("Paid " + usd + " via PayPal");
    }
}
```

### Adapters

```java
class StripeAdapter implements PaymentProcessor {
    private StripeAPI stripe;

    public StripeAdapter(StripeAPI stripe) {
        this.stripe = stripe;
    }

    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        stripe.makePayment((int) amount); // convert double to int
    }
}

class PayPalAdapter implements PaymentProcessor {
    private PayPalAPI paypal;

    public PayPalAdapter(PayPalAPI paypal) {
        this.paypal = paypal;
    }

    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        paypal.sendMoney(amount);
    }
}
```

### Client

```java
public class AdapterDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PaymentProcessor stripe = new StripeAdapter(new StripeAPI());
        stripe.pay(100.75);

        PaymentProcessor paypal = new PayPalAdapter(new PayPalAPI());
        paypal.pay(250.50);
    }
}
```

‚úÖ Output:

```
Paid 100 via Stripe
Paid 250.5 via PayPal
```

# 5. When to Use Adapter

* You want to use a **third-party library** but its API doesn‚Äôt match yours.
* You need to **reuse legacy code** without rewriting it.
* You want to **standardize access** to multiple different APIs.

---

# 6. Key Benefits

* Promotes **code reusability** (don‚Äôt rewrite existing code).
* Follows **Open/Closed Principle** (add new adapters without changing client code).
* Makes client code **cleaner** by working with a common interface.

---

üëâ In short:
**Adapter = ‚ÄúTranslator‚Äù between incompatible interfaces.**
It solves the problem of ‚ÄúI want to use this class, but its methods don‚Äôt fit what my system expects.‚Äù

Do you want me to also show you the **difference between Adapter and Decorator**? (Many people confuse them in interviews!)
