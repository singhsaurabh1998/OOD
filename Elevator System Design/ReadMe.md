Perfect! Designing an **Elevator System** is a classic and highly practical Object-Oriented Design (OOD) problem. It gives you a chance to apply **core OOP concepts, design patterns, and concurrency**.

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Problem Understanding — Basic Elevator System

### 🎯 Scope of Basic Design:

We will **focus on core functionalities** first:

* Building has multiple floors (e.g., 1 to 10).
* One or more elevators.
* Elevator moves up and down.
* Handles **floor requests** (external + internal).
* Tracks elevator direction and current floor.
* Handles door open/close.
* Only a single passenger for now (simplifies concurrency).

---

## 🧱 Step 2: Define the Core Entities (Basic OOD)

### ✅ 1. `Elevator`

* `id`
* `currentFloor`
* `direction` (UP, DOWN, IDLE)
* `status` (MOVING, STOPPED, IDLE)
* `requests`: Queue of pending floors
* `move()`, `openDoor()`, `closeDoor()`

### ✅ 2. `Floor`

* `floorNumber`
* `hasUpRequest`
* `hasDownRequest`

### ✅ 3. `ElevatorController`

* Manages all elevators
* Routes requests to the appropriate elevator

### ✅ 4. `Request`

* `sourceFloor`
* `direction` (UP/DOWN)
* (Later: `destinationFloor` for internal request)

### ✅ 5. `Direction` (Enum)

```java
public enum Direction {
    UP, DOWN, IDLE;
}
```

Absolutely! Before diving into classes, it's excellent practice to identify the **basic use cases (functional requirements)** for the Elevator System. This will guide our class responsibilities and interactions.

## 🧾 Basic Use Cases for Elevator System (Step-by-Step Roadmap)

---

### 🟡 1. **User Calls an Elevator (External Request)**

* User on a floor presses **Up/Down** button.
* System assigns the best elevator to serve the request.

✅ Example:

* User on floor 5 presses "Down".
* Controller assigns Elevator E1, which is idle at floor 3.

---

### 🟡 2. **User Selects Destination Inside Elevator (Internal Request)**

* Once inside, user presses a **floor button** (e.g., "9").
* That floor is added to the elevator’s pending queue.

✅ Example:

* Passenger inside elevator presses "Floor 9".
* Elevator will stop at 9 before becoming idle again.

---

### 🟡 3. **Elevator Moves to Requested Floor**

* Elevator changes direction, moves up/down.
* Skips unnecessary floors unless there’s a request.

✅ Example:

* Elevator at floor 3, gets request for 7.
* Moves: 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 (stopping only at 7 unless there are other intermediate requests).

---

### 🟡 4. **Elevator Door Operations**

* Once elevator reaches requested floor:

    * Opens door
    * Waits briefly
    * Closes door
* Then processes next request (if any)

✅ This is typically automatic and tied to `move()`.

---

### 🟡 5. **Idle State & Next Pickup**

* After completing all requests, elevator becomes IDLE.
* Can be picked again for new external calls.

---

### 🟡 6. **Elevator Direction and Prioritization**

* Elevator should serve requests **in the same direction first** before reversing.
* Direction determines which requests it accepts.

✅ Example:

* Elevator going UP from floor 2 → 10

    * Will accept pickup from floors 3, 5, 8
    * Will **not** stop at floor 1 (DOWN) until trip completes.

---

### 🟡 7. **Multiple Elevators (for future enhancement)**

* Controller picks best elevator based on:

    * Distance
    * Direction
    * Current load (future)
    * Status (idle, moving)

## ✅ Summary of Use Cases

| Use Case ID | Description                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| UC1         | User presses Up/Down from a floor                  |
| UC2         | User selects destination inside elevator           |
| UC3         | Elevator moves and serves requests                 |
| UC4         | Elevator opens/closes doors at stop                |
| UC5         | Elevator goes idle after all requests served       |
| UC6         | Elevator optimizes direction-based serving         |
| UC7         | (Future) Elevator Controller chooses best elevator |

Shall we begin with:

1. Defining the `Direction`, `ElevatorStatus`, and `Request` enums?
2. Then implementing the core `Elevator` class?

Let’s proceed step by step.
