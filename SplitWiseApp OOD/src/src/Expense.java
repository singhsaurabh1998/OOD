import java.util.List;

/*
Generates a unique expenseId (auto-increment static counter).
Stores metadata: description, total amount, payer (paidByUserId), optional associated group (groupId).
Holds the computed list of Split objects that specify how the total is divided among participants (already calculated by a SplitStrategy; Expense does not compute splits itself).
Serves as a historical ledger entry: added to a groupâ€™s groupExpenses or the global individual expenses map.
Provides no business logic: settlement, balance updates, and simplification happen elsewhere (Group / Splitwise / DebtSimplifier).
