This is a **great design problem** 👏 — it mixes **caching, eviction policies, multi-tier storage**, and forces you to think in terms of **extensibility + design patterns**. Let’s break it step by step.

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Requirements & Assumptions

* Multi-tier cache → **RAM (100 MB) → SSD (2 TB) → HDD (∞)**.
* Access flow:

    * `GET(key)` → check top layer (RAM). If not found → SSD → HDD.
    * If found in a lower tier, promote it back to higher tier (**cache promotion**).
* `PUT(key, value)` → always insert into RAM.

    * If RAM is full → evict **least recently used (LRU)** → push to SSD.
    * If SSD is full → evict **LRU** → push to HDD.
    * If HDD is full → apply a policy (discard or archival).
* Each tier has **different latency and capacity**.
* Extensible: tomorrow we may add GPU-memory-cache, distributed Redis, etc.

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Design Patterns to Use

1. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**

    * Each cache tier (RAM, SSD, HDD) is a **handler**.
    * `GET` → passes request down the chain until key is found.
    * `PUT` → always starts at top and pushes evictions down.

2. **Strategy Pattern**

    * For **Eviction policy** (LRU, LFU, FIFO, etc.).
    * Each cache tier can plug in its own eviction strategy.

3. **Decorator / Composite Pattern** (optional)

    * To treat all tiers as one "big cache" while keeping internal tier details hidden.

4. **Singleton**

    * For global `CacheManager`.

## 🔹 Step 3: Core Classes (UML-ish)

```
                +------------------+
                |   CacheManager   |  (Facade for clients)
                +------------------+
                | +get(key)        |
                | +put(key,value)  |
                +------------------+
                          |
                          v
               +---------------------+
               |   CacheTier (abst.) |<----------------+
               +---------------------+                 |
               | -capacity           |                 |
               | -evictionPolicy     | (Strategy)      |
               | -nextTier           | (Chain)         |
               +---------------------+                 |
               | +get(key)           |                 |
               | +put(key,value)     |                 |
               +---------------------+                 |
                      ^                                |
        +--------------------------+   +---------------------------+
        | InMemoryCache (RAM)      |   | FileCache (SSD / HDD)     |
        +--------------------------+   +---------------------------+
```

* **CacheTier** → abstract base for all caches.
* **InMemoryCache** → RAM (HashMap + LinkedHashMap for LRU).
* **FileCache** → SSD/HDD (simulated with file or DB).
* **EvictionPolicy** → strategy interface (`Evict()` method).

---

## 🔹 Key Benefits of This Design

* **SOLID compliance**

    * SRP → Each tier handles only its own storage.
    * OCP → Add new tier (like Redis) without breaking others.
    * DIP → Higher-level code depends on abstraction `CacheTier`.

* **Design Patterns applied**

    * **Chain of Responsibility** → multi-tier cache flow.
    * **Strategy** → eviction policy.
    * **Facade** → `CacheManager` hides internal tier details.
    * **Singleton** → `CacheManager` could be global.

---

⚡So in interview you’d say:

* I’ll model each tier as a `CacheTier` in a **Chain of Responsibility**.
* Eviction handled via **Strategy pattern**.
* `CacheManager` acts as a **Facade** for client code.
* Extensible to new tiers or new eviction strategies.

## 🔹 Step-by-Step Explanation of Flow

### 1) Insert A and B

* Both go into **RAM** since space available.
* RAM = \[A, B], SSD = \[], HDD = \[].

### 2) Insert C

* RAM is full (capacity 2).
* Evict **LRU (A)** → push it into **SSD**.
* Put C into RAM.
* RAM = \[B, C], SSD = \[A], HDD = \[].

### 3) Get(A)

* A not found in RAM.
* Go down → found in **SSD**.
* Promote A back to RAM.
* RAM evicts LRU (B) to SSD.
* Final: RAM = \[C, A], SSD = \[B], HDD = \[].

## ✅ Why This Design Is Good?

* **Chain of Responsibility** → request flows through tiers.
* **Strategy Pattern** → LRU can be swapped with LFU or FIFO easily.
* **Facade** → `CacheManager` hides tier logic from client.
* **SOLID** → each tier is independent and only cares about its storage.
